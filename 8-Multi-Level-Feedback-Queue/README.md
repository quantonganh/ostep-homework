MLFQ:
- Rule 1: if priority(A) > priority(B), A runs
- Rule 2: if priority(A) = priority(B), round robin
- Rule 3: when a job enters the system, please it at the highest priority
- Rule 4: Once a job uses up its time, reduce the priority
- Rule 5: After some time, move all jobs to the topmost queue

## 8.2

> As you can see in the example, the job enters at the highest priority (Q2). After a single time-slice of 10 ms, 
> the scheduler reduces the jobâ€™s priority by one, and thus the job is on Q1. After running at Q1 for a time slice, 
> the job is finally lowered to the lowest priority in the system (Q0),

> Figure 8.4 shows an example of how this works, with an interactive job B (shown in gray) that needs the CPU only for 1 ms 
> before performing an I/O competing for the CPU with a long-running batch job A (shown in black). 
> The MLFQ approach keeps B at the highest priority because B keeps releasing the CPU; 
> if B is an interactive job, MLFQ further achieves its goal of running interactive jobs quickly.

## 8.5

> Two graphs are shown in Figure 8.5 (page 6). On the left, there is no priority boost,

> but used here for the example), and thus we at least guarantee that the long-running job will make some progress, 
> getting boosted to the highest priority every 50 ms and thus getting to run periodically.
