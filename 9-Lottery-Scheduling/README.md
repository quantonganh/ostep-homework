1. Compute the solutions for simulations with 3 jobs and random seeds of 1, 2, and 3.

```sh
$ ./lottery.py -j 3 -s 1
ARG jlist
ARG jobs 3
ARG maxlen 10
ARG maxticket 100
ARG quantum 1
ARG seed 1

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job:
  Job 0 ( length = 1, tickets = 84 )
  Job 1 ( length = 7, tickets = 25 )
  Job 2 ( length = 4, tickets = 44 )


Here is the set of random numbers you will need (at most):
Random 651593
```

tickets = 84 + 25 + 44 = 153
651593 % 153 = 119 -> run 2

```sh
$ ./lottery.py -j 3 -s 1 -c
ARG jlist
ARG jobs 3
ARG maxlen 10
ARG maxticket 100
ARG quantum 1
ARG seed 1

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job:
  Job 0 ( length = 1, tickets = 84 )
  Job 1 ( length = 7, tickets = 25 )
  Job 2 ( length = 4, tickets = 44 )


** Solutions **

Random 651593 -> Winning ticket 119 (of 153) -> Run 2
  Jobs:
 (  job:0 timeleft:1 tix:84 )  (  job:1 timeleft:7 tix:25 )  (* job:2 timeleft:4 tix:44 )
```

2. Now run with two specific jobs: each of length 10, but one (job 0) with just 1 ticket and the other (job 1) with 100 (e.g., `-l 10:1,10:100`). What happens when the number of tickets is so imbalanced? Will job 0 ever run before job 1 completes? How often? In general, what does such a ticket imbalance do to the behavior of lottery scheduling?

```sh
$ ./lottery.py -l 10:1,10:100 -c
ARG jlist 10:1,10:100
ARG jobs 3
ARG maxlen 10
ARG maxticket 100
ARG quantum 1
ARG seed 0

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job:
  Job 0 ( length = 10, tickets = 1 )
  Job 1 ( length = 10, tickets = 100 )


** Solutions **

Random 844422 -> Winning ticket 62 (of 101) -> Run 1
  Jobs:
 (  job:0 timeleft:10 tix:1 )  (* job:1 timeleft:10 tix:100 )
```

> What happens when the number of tickets is so imbalanced?

Job 1 will have more opportunities to run.

> Will job 0 ever run before job 1 completes? How often?

1/100

> In general, what does such a ticket imbalance do to the behavior of lottery scheduling?

1. Probability of selection: process with more tickets will have a higher probability of being selected
2. Fairness: uneven distribution of resources and reduces fairness
3. Performance implications: reduce throughput and increase response time for processes with lower tickets.
